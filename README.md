# Triathlon Race-Day Nutrition Planner

## Nutrition - The Lost Fourth Discipline 

**Overview**

This application will assist in nutrition planning for various triathlons. Based on race distance and conditions, the application will create a tailored race nutrition strategy for triathletes in accordance with their biometrics. The strategies would be developed based on established guidelines to ensure that the essential macronutrients and calories are absorbed throughout the duration of the race.

**Users**

This application will mostly be used by triathletes to plan their fuelling/nutrition strategy prior to a race. However, it could also be used by endurance athletes practicing any of the three disciplines comprising triathlons – swimming, cycling, and running. 

**Personal Note**

This project is of interest to me as I failed to efficiently devise a race nutrition strategy for my first half-ironman distance triathlon and ended up suffering from intense cramps throughout the run leg. I believe there is immense need for this tool as there are no nutrition calculators that exist that specifically tailor one’s optimal macro intake to specific race conditions.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add personal nutritional/food items and/or supplements such as gels, gummies, fruits, etc. to be used in the development of the nutrition plan. I want to be able to add an arbitrary number of items to the plan based on my preferences and what's available to me.
- As a user, I want to be able to view a complete race nutrition strategy showing a list of the items to be consumed, macronutrient content, and timing for consumption to help me understand and follow the strategy effectively.
- As a user, I want to be able to adjust the race nutrition strategy to specific race conditions such as temperature, humidity, estimated durations, etc. to adapt it to any varying environmental factors.
- As a user, I want to be able to rate the effectiveness of the race nutrition strategy post-race and record my feedback.
