# Triathlon Race-Day Nutrition Planner

## Nutrition - The Lost Fourth Discipline 

**Overview**

This application will assist in nutrition planning for various triathlons during a racing season. Based on race distance and anticipated race conditions, the application will create tailored nutrition strategies for triathletes, in accordance with their biometrics, over the course of a racing season. The strategies would be developed based on established nutritional guidelines to ensure that the essential macronutrients and calories are absorbed throughout the duration of the race.

**Users**

This application will mostly be used by triathletes to plan their fuelling/nutrition strategies prior to a racing season. However, it could also be used by endurance athletes practicing any of the three disciplines comprising triathlons – swimming, cycling, and running. 

**Personal Note**

This project is of interest to me as I failed to efficiently devise a race nutrition strategy for my first half-ironman distance triathlon and ended up suffering from intense cramps throughout the run leg. I believe there is immense need for this tool as there are no nutrition calculators that exist that specifically tailor one’s optimal macro intake to specific race conditions.
