# Triathlon Race-Day Nutrition Planner

## Nutrition - The Lost Fourth Discipline 

**Overview**

This application will assist in nutrition planning for various triathlons. Based on race distance and conditions, the application will create a tailored race nutrition strategy for triathletes in accordance with their biometrics. The strategies would be developed based on established guidelines to ensure that the essential macronutrients and calories are absorbed.

**Users**

This application will mostly be used triathletes to plan their fuelling/nutrition strategy prior to a race. However, it could also be used by endurance athletes practicing any of the three disciplines comprising triathlons – swimming, cycling, and running. 

**Personal Note**

This project is of interest to me as I failed to efficiently devise a race nutrition strategy for my first half-ironman distance triathlon and ended up suffering from intense cramps throughout the run leg. I believe there is immense need for this tool as there are no nutrition calculators that exist that specifically tailor one’s optimal macro intake to specific race conditions.
